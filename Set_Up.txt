********** TESTING **********
*****************************

The site pulls up fine in Firefox and Chrome, I haven't tried to do anything yet.
Logged in fine on Firefox and Chrome.
Created a board fine in both Firefox and Chrome.
Viewed that board in Chrome and Firefox just fine.
Tried to create a story in Firefox and Chrome, it didn't error but nothing actually got added.

boards, sprints, users, users_boards, and users_openids have stuff in them and seem correct.
invitations, tasks, and users_tasks are empty and should be.
stories and users_stories are empty and shouldn't be.

Here's the output from Flask when I tried to create a story with Firefox.

I also found these pieces of Flask output interesting. They came when I hit refresh on the page.

I did this entire process with localhost and I get a broken pipe from both Firefox and Chrome when I try to add a story. Here's the printout from Flask below.
